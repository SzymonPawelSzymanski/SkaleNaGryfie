# Skalenagryfie1
 is a university project I've written using C# Framework Monogame.
 It'a simple drag&drop game that helps you learn the placement of the notes on the fretboard of the bass guitar.
 
 
Directories
- Content - any media included in the project, textures, fonts, sounds, etc.
- Core - Any crucial code files, like Game1.cs, Data.cs, Program.cs and also skala_pentatoniczna.cs (main class for the primary object of the game)
- Managers - includes only GameStateManager.cs for now
- States - all the possible states of the game

Program.cs is what starts and runs the game.
Game1.cs is esentially the main file of the game - I tried to put as little as possible there, only some window parametrs, defined the GameStateMangers (which manages gamestates) and load some content.
// README will be completed soon
